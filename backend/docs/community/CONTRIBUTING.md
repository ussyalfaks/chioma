## Introduction

Chioma is an open-source platform built on the Stellar blockchain, connecting landlords, agents, and tenants through a hybrid architecture that combines on-chain settlement with off-chain business logic.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v20+ recommended)
- **pnpm** (v9+ recommended)
- **Rust** (latest stable)
- **Soroban CLI** (latest version compatible with Stellar network)
- **Docker** (optional, for running local databases)

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/caxtonacollins/chioma.git
    cd chioma
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    Navigate to the backend and frontend directories and run:

    ```bash
    cd backend && pnpm install
    cd ../frontend && pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables**:
    - **Backend**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in `backend/` and configure your database and Stellar credentials.
    - **Frontend**: Copy `.env.example` (if available) or create `.env.local` in `frontend/` with necessary API endpoints.

## Development Workflow

### Backend (NestJS)

Located in `backend/`.

- **Run in development mode**:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  pnpm start:dev
  ```
- **Run tests**:
  ```bash
  pnpm test
  ```
- **Lint code**:
  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  ```

### Frontend (Next.js)

Located in `frontend/`.

- **Run in development mode**:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  pnpm dev
  ```
- **Build for production**:
  ```bash
  pnpm build
  ```
- **Lint code**:
  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  ```

### Smart Contracts (Soroban)

Located in `contract/`.

- **Build contracts**:
  ```bash
  cd contract
  cargo build
  ```
- **Run tests**:
  ```bash
  cargo test
  ```
- **Format code**:
  ```bash
  cargo fmt
  ```

## Code Style

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: We use **Prettier** and **ESLint**. Run `pnpm format` or `pnpm lint` before committing.
- **Rust**: We use **Rustfmt**. Run `cargo fmt` before committing.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch for your changes
2. Ensure all tests pass locally before submission
3. Submit a pull request with a comprehensive description of your changes
4. Reference any related issues in your pull request description
5. Address reviewer feedback promptly and professionally

We appreciate your contributions to the Chioma platform.

## Local Pipeline Validation

You can execute the same validation checks used by our CI/CD pipeline locally before submitting a pull request. Each component includes a `check-all.sh` script that performs formatting, linting, building, and testing.

- Frontend: Execute from the repository root or the `frontend` directory:
  - Script location: [frontend/check-all.sh](frontend/check-all.sh)

  ```bash
  ./frontend/check-all.sh
  ```

- Backend: Execute from the repository root or the `backend` directory:
  - Script location: [backend/check-all.sh](backend/check-all.sh)

  ```bash
  ./backend/check-all.sh
  ```

- Contracts: Execute from the repository root or the `contract` directory:
  - Script location: [contract/check-all.sh](contract/check-all.sh)

  ```bash
  ./contract/check-all.sh
  ```

Each script terminates immediately upon encountering an error (`set -e`), ensuring that any failing step halts execution and returns a non-zero exit code. Use these scripts to validate your changes locally and minimize CI/CD iteration cycles.
