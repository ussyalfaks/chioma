## 2. Release Planning

### 2.1 Release Types

| Release Type | Frequency | Scope                            | Risk Level |
| ------------ | --------- | -------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Hotfix       | As needed | Critical bug fixes               | Low        |
| Patch        | Weekly    | Bug fixes, minor improvements    | Low        |
| Minor        | Bi-weekly | New features, enhancements       | Medium     |
| Major        | Quarterly | Breaking changes, major features | High       |

### 2.2 Release Cadence

Standard release schedule:

- Patch releases: Every Tuesday at 10:00 AM UTC
- Minor releases: Every other Tuesday at 10:00 AM UTC
- Major releases: Planned quarterly, announced 30 days in advance
- Hotfixes: As needed, with emergency approval

### 2.3 Release Planning Process

1. Feature freeze (T-7 days for minor, T-14 days for major)
2. Code review and testing (T-5 days)
3. Staging deployment and validation (T-3 days)
4. Release notes preparation (T-2 days)
5. Stakeholder communication (T-1 day)
6. Production deployment (T-0)
7. Post-deployment monitoring (T+1 day)
8. Retrospective (T+3 days)

### 2.4 Release Approval

Approval requirements by release type:

| Release Type | Approvers Required                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Hotfix       | Engineering Lead + On-call               |
| Patch        | Engineering Lead                         |
| Minor        | Engineering Lead + Product Manager       |
| Major        | Engineering Lead + Product Manager + CTO |

### 2.5 Release Criteria

All releases must meet:

- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Release notes prepared
- [ ] Staging validation completed
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards ready
- [ ] On-call team notified

---

## 3. Versioning Strategy

### 3.1 Semantic Versioning

Chioma follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- MAJOR: Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- MINOR: New features, backward-compatible
- PATCH: Bug fixes, backward-compatible

Examples:

- `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`: Patch release (bug fix)
- `1.0.1` → `1.1.0`: Minor release (new feature)
- `1.1.0` → `2.0.0`: Major release (breaking change)

### 3.2 Version Tagging

Git tags for releases:

```bash
# Create release tag
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3"

# Push tag to remote
git push origin v1.2.3

# List all tags
git tag -l
```

Tag naming convention:

- Release: `v1.2.3`
- Release candidate: `v1.2.3-rc.1`
- Beta: `v1.2.3-beta.1`
- Alpha: `v1.2.3-alpha.1`

### 3.3 Branch Strategy

Branch model:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for next release
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fix branches
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches

Release branch workflow:

```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Finalize release (version bump, changelog)
npm version minor
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare release v1.2.0"

# Merge to main and tag
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge release/v1.2.0

# Push everything
git push origin main develop v1.2.0

# Delete release branch
git branch -d release/v1.2.0
```

### 3.4 API Versioning

API versions follow the pattern: `/api/v{major}`

- Breaking changes require new major version
- Maintain previous version for deprecation period
- Document deprecation timeline in release notes

See [API Versioning](../api/API-VERSIONING.md) for details.

## 6. Release Rollback

### 6.1 Rollback Decision Criteria

Initiate rollback when:

- Critical functionality is broken
- Data integrity is at risk
- Security vulnerability introduced
- Performance degradation >50%
- Error rate >10%
- Unable to mitigate within 30 minutes

### 6.2 Rollback Procedure

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rollback-release.sh

set -euo pipefail

PREVIOUS_VERSION="${1}"
REASON="${2:-unspecified}"

echo "Rolling back to version ${PREVIOUS_VERSION}"
echo "Reason: ${REASON}"

# 1. Announce rollback
./scripts/notify-team.sh "ROLLBACK: Reverting to v${PREVIOUS_VERSION}. Reason: ${REASON}"

# 2. Deploy previous version
kubectl set image deployment/chioma-backend \
  chioma-backend=ghcr.io/chioma/backend:${PREVIOUS_VERSION}

# 3. Wait for rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/chioma-backend

# 4. Rollback database migration if needed
read -p "Rollback database migration? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
echo
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
  ./scripts/rollback-migration.sh
fi

# 5. Verify health
curl -f https://api.chioma.io/health || exit 1

# 6. Run smoke tests
./scripts/smoke-tests.sh production

# 7. Monitor metrics
echo "Monitor dashboards for 15 minutes"
echo "Grafana: https://grafana.chioma.io"

# 8. Document rollback
cat > "rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md" <<EOF
# Rollback Report

Date: $(date)
Previous Version: ${PREVIOUS_VERSION}
Reason: ${REASON}
Operator: $(whoami)

## Actions Taken
- Reverted application to v${PREVIOUS_VERSION}
- Database migration rollback: ${REPLY}

## Verification
- Health check: Passed
- Smoke tests: Passed

## Next Steps
- [ ] Root cause analysis
- [ ] Fix and retest
- [ ] Schedule new release
EOF

echo "Rollback completed"
```

### 6.3 Database Migration Rollback

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rollback-migration.sh

set -euo pipefail

echo "Rolling back last database migration"

# Get last migration
LAST_MIGRATION=$(npm run typeorm migration:show | grep "X" | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}')

echo "Last executed migration: ${LAST_MIGRATION}"

# Confirm rollback
read -p "Rollback migration ${LAST_MIGRATION}? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
echo
if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
  echo "Rollback cancelled"
  exit 1
fi

# Create backup before rollback
./scripts/backup-pre-rollback.sh

# Rollback migration
npm run typeorm migration:revert

# Verify database state
npm run typeorm migration:show

echo "Migration rollback completed"
```

### 6.4 Partial Rollback

For feature-specific issues, use feature flags:

```typescript
// Disable feature without full rollback
await this.featureFlagService.disable('new-feature');

// Or via API
curl -X POST https://api.chioma.io/admin/feature-flags/new-feature/disable \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ADMIN_TOKEN}"
```
